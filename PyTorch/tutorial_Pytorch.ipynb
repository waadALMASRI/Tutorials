    "\n",
    "Pytorch is betten than Tensorflow and Keras by:\n",
    "1. easier debugging\n",
    "2. dynamic computational graph construction unlike Tensorflow and Keras that use a static one\n",
    "3. supported by Facebook, Twitter, NVIDIA, etc.\n",
    "4. works easily with numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computational Graph\n",
    "A Computational graph is a set of calculations. it is formed of nodes such that every node is either the input or the output or a calculation node.\n",
    "**Advantages:** <br>\n",
    "1. each node is an independent piece of code => this allows performance optimization methods to be included like *threading, multiprocessing, parallelism, etc.* \n",
    "2. all deep learning frameworks (Tensorflow, Theano, PyTorch) involve constructing a computational graph: neural network are built based on these graphs; the gradients in a NN back-propagate through these graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tensors\n",
    "1. A tensor is a matrix data stucture\n",
    "2. essential components of deep learning libraries\n",
    "3. essential for efficient computation: operations between tensors are effectively calculated via GPUs\n",
    "4. numpy slice functionality is available\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AutoGrad\n",
    "1. It is a mechanism where error gradients are calculated and back-propagated through a computational graph in PyTorch.\n",
    "2. The **Variable class** is the main component of this autograd system.\n",
    "    1. It wraps a tensor T\n",
    "    2. It allows automatic gradient computation on the tensor T when *.bacward()* function is called\n",
    "3. the object contains:\n",
    "    1. data of the tensor\n",
    "    2. gradient of the tensor (calculated with respect to the loss)\n",
    "    3. reference to the function that called the variable (the reference is set to null if this function is created by the user)"
